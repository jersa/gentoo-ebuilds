## jerm's gentoo ebuilds


This repository contains ebuilds for use with [Portage](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Portage), the package manager used with [Gentoo Linux](https://www.gentoo.org).
These ebuilds may be in varying states of development.

While I do strive for quality when writing and testing these ebuilds, if you choose to install any of them on your own system, you assume all risk involved and acknowlege that you probably know what you're getting into. :)
